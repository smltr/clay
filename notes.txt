Language concept

I've had this idea for a while around creating a language that clicked with me.

possible name: clay

Some ideas

  clean but also meaningful syntax

  how do I say it in my head when I type it?

  thoughtful and useful constructs
  - nice loops
    - easily map/reduce maybe, but in a more intuitive way


  - use of symbols instead of words for language constructs
    - possibly all built in funcs could be behind a symbol representing the package containing built ins
    - @.len()

  ability to extend or change syntax
     don't like how loops are worded? change 'for' to 'loop'

  nice repl where you can edit previous lines easily

  easy prints/debugging mode

  easily define tests, possibly near functions as part of the definition

  easy way to interface with other files
     i like go's //embed
     easy way to define test data

  be able to define types and structs but also dynamic for easy prototyping

  intuitive typing with logic
     type BigNumber = Number that's > 100
     this would be like an abstract type instead of using a where clause on function signature

What I like/don't like about other languages:

    * Golang:
        + simple and easy for loops and ranges
        + fast
        + great standard packages
        + easy to define structs and types
        - Not interactive
        - no repl
        - if err != nil
        - no way to extend language
    * Elixir:
        + Very interactive, iex
        + clean syntax
        - not easy to define custom data types
        - Hard to reason about looping over list (e.g. Enum.graphemes())
        - only one paradigm, functional

Common tools that need to be in a language:

    + Defining what stuff looks like: Being able to define custom types, especially with fields is important
    + Defining what stuff does: Functions
    + Separating stuff: Modules, namespaces

Things I encounter that stop me from wanting to start a project:

    - not easy to quickly get to feedback loop where I can see what I'm doing
    - moving between code files and terminal or web browser
    - defining tests being cumbersome or not obvious

    - trying to remember language constructs if it's a language I'm not familiar with
    - not easily being able to navigate language constructs with autocomplete
    - sure, if I remember that there is a strings package, I can type strings. and see some suggestions, but how do I easily bring up that there is a strings package?

    - trying to decide how to structure files and modules
    - I should be able to just start typing some code and get immediate feedback, not have to think through structure
    - project should be like clay. just lay a lump down and start pulling parts out
    - I should always be able to start with just one file in a directory
